# get the credit card üí≥

this is a simple node.js project that provides information about credit cards through API calls. the application retrieves details about credit cards, including validity, scheme (VISA, MASTERCARD, AMEX), and, when available, the bank.

## description

the goal is to retrieve a series of information on credit cards through API calls.
the application should provide its consumers with the details about credit cards:

- valid/not valid;
- the scheme (i.e VISA, MASTERCARD or AMEX);
- the bank when it is available.

### step 1

create a REST API service that will reply to a GET call. The endpoint should look like this: this:

`GET <web-server-address>/api/card-scheme/verify/<card-number>`

in case of successful response, the returned object should look like this:

```
{
  "success": true
    "payload" : {
          "scheme": "visa",
          "type" : "debit",
          "bank" : "UBS"
        }
}
```

to obtain this information, you should use a 3rd party service, such as [BinList](https://binlist.net/).

### step 2 (incomplete for now)

create a REST API service that will reply to a GET call. The endpoint should look like this:

`GET <web-server-address>/api/card-scheme/stats?start=1&limit=3`

in case of successful response, the returned object should look like this:

```
{
      "success": true
      "start": 1,
      "limit": 3,
      "size": 133,
      "payload": {
        "<card-xyz>": 5,
        "<card-jkl>": 4,
        "<card-bnm>": 1
      }
}
```

where `size` represents the byte of the payload. Inside the payload, provide the list of cards that were checked in the step 1 alongside the number of requests made for each card. You can store this information in memory or on a file.
